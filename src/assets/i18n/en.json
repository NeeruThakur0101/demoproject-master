If you select to service a larger or smaller coverage territory for a specific trade  you may create a separate profile for that trade.

The only exception is to the Catastrophe profile please indicate any areas you would consider providing assistance in a catastrophic situation. Changes made to your coverage territory will be submitted to Membership Services for processing and approval. If your changes are approved  you will receive notification of acceptance. If your changes are not approved  you will be contacted by a Contractor Connection representative.
